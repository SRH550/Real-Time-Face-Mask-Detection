Internship Project

――――――――――――――――――――

▼About the project the intern will be participating.

We are launching an internship program for highly skilled science and engineering students from the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and other top universities in India. The internship will be conducted online for approximately two months, between May and July (depending on the participants’ summer vacation schedules), and is open to bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD students graduating in 2027.



During the internship, participants will work on developing DX (digital transformation) systems aimed at improving operational efficiency within Members Co.,Ltd. Specifically, interns will engage in the refactoring and enhancement of the company's internal HR management and project management systems, allowing them to refine their technical skills.



The DX systems to be refactored and enhanced are primarily internal systems used by Japanese employees. As a result, API documentation and UI/UX improvement guidelines are predominantly written in Japanese. While we will strive to translate as much as possible into English, some nuances may be lost in translation. Therefore, we encourage mutual understanding and open communication to ensure smooth collaboration throughout the internship.



We hope this internship provides valuable hands-on development experience while deepening your understanding of Japan’s DX systems.
